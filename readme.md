# Battleship Socket Game with Python and C#

This powerful and versatile combination enables robust bidirectional connections across different platforms.

## Description

This project was created for a university (UAI) practical assignment, aiming to develop a video game in WinForms using a layered architecture. The project also implements a client-server model where communication follows the TCP protocol between sockets. The client (C#) connects to a server (Python) to play a game of Battleship.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed.
- Development environment for C# (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code with C# extension, etc.).

## Quick Start Guide

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lichadev/csharp_battleship.git
```

Open the C# solution in your development environment and build the project.

Run the Python script to start the server.

```bash
cd csharp_battleship/server
python server.py
```
Run the WinForms application to connect to the server and begin communication.
